This project demonstrates the use of **VBA Macros** to automate the insertion of headers and format data in an Excel worksheet. The macro simplifies repetitive formatting tasks, ensuring consistency and saving time.

## Features

  - Font size and style adjustments.
  - Cell alignment (e.g., center-aligned headers).
  - Column width adjustments to fit content.

## Skills Demonstrated
- VBA Macros
- Excel Automation
- Data Formatting

## How to Use
1. **Open the File**: Download and open the `InsertingAndFormattingText.xlsx` file in Microsoft Excel.
2. **Enable Macros**: Upon opening, ensure you enable macros to allow the VBA script to execute.
3. **Run the Macro**:
   - Navigate to the `Developer` tab (if enabled).
   - Select **Macros** and run the `InsertAndFormatHeaders` macro (or similar, based on the macro's name in the file).
4. **Observe the Changes**: The macro will automatically:
   - Insert headers at the top of the data range.
   - Apply formatting to improve readability.

## Requirements
