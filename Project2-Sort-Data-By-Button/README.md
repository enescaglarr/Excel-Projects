# Project 2: Sort Data by Button

## Description
This project demonstrates an interactive data sorting feature in Excel using **VBA Macros**. The user can click a button in the worksheet, select a column to sort, and the macro handles the sorting automatically. This project is an example of how macros can enhance interactivity and simplify complex tasks in Excel.

## Features
- **Interactive Prompt**: A message box allows the user to choose the column to sort by:
  - `1` for Division
  - `2` for Category
  - `3` for Total Sales
- **Button-Driven Action**: Users can initiate sorting by clicking a button on the worksheet.
- **Dynamic Sorting**: The macro sorts data based on the userâ€™s input.

## Skills Demonstrated
- VBA Macros
- Interactive User Input Handling
- Data Sorting in Excel

## How to Use
1. **Open the File**: Download and open the `Project2Sorting.xlsm` file in Microsoft Excel.

3. **Click the Button**:
   - Locate the button labeled "Sort Data" on the worksheet.

   - Enter the column number corresponding to the data you want to sort and click OK.
5. **Observe Sorted Data**: The data will be sorted based on your selection.

## Requirements
- **Microsoft Excel**: Ensure macros are enabled in your Excel settings.
- **Macro-Enabled Workbook**: The file must remain in `.xlsm` format to retain macro functionality.
