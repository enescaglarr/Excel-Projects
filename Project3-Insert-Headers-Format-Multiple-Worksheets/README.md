# Project 3: Insert Headers and Format Multiple Worksheets

## Description
This project showcases the use of **VBA Macros** to automate the insertion of headers and formatting across multiple worksheets in a single workbook. The macro ensures consistent styling and formatting, simplifying the task of preparing data for analysis.

## Features
- **Multi-Sheet Automation**: Inserts headers and formats data across 3-4 worksheets within the workbook.
- **Consistent Formatting**:
  - Applies uniform header styling.
  - Formats data rows for readability (e.g., adjusting font size, alignment, and cell colors).
- **Dynamic Worksheet Handling**: Automatically identifies active worksheets for processing.

## Skills Demonstrated
- VBA Macros
- Excel Automation
- Multi-Sheet Data Management

## How to Use
1. **Open the File**: Download and open the `project3.xltm` file in Microsoft Excel.
2. **Enable Macros**: Ensure macros are enabled to allow the VBA scripts to execute.
3. **Run the Macro**:
   - Navigate to the `Developer` tab.
   - Select **Macros** and run the `InsertHeadersAndFormat` macro (or similarly named macro in the file).
4. **Observe Changes**:
   - Headers will be inserted at the top of each worksheet.
   - Data will be formatted consistently for easier interpretation.

## Requirements
- **Microsoft Excel**: Ensure that your Excel settings allow for macros to run.
- **Macro-Enabled Template**: The file is in `.xltm` format, designed to support VBA macros.

## Example
1. **Input**: A workbook containing multiple worksheets with unformatted data.
2. **Output**: Each worksheet is processed with headers added, and the data is formatted for readability.
