# Project 4: Automate Total Sales Calculation

## Description
This project automates the process of calculating the total sales across multiple worksheets in an Excel workbook. Using **VBA Macros**, it sums the values under the `Total Sales` column in each worksheet and displays the grand total in an easily accessible format.

## Features
- **Automated Summation**: Calculates the sum of all rows under the `Total Sales` column across multiple worksheets.
- **Cross-Sheet Calculation**: Gathers data from multiple worksheets in the workbook.
- **Dynamic Total Display**: Places the calculated total at the end of the `Total Sales` column in each worksheet.

## Skills Demonstrated
- VBA Macros
- Data Summation and Aggregation
- Multi-Sheet Automation

## How to Use
1. **Open the File**: Download and open the `Project4AutomateSumFunction.xlsm` file in Microsoft Excel.
