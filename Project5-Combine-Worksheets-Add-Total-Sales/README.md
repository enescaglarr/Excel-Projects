# Project 5: Combine Worksheets and Add Total Sales

## Description
This project automates the process of combining data from multiple worksheets into a consolidated report. Using **VBA Macros**, it merges data from selected worksheets, calculates the total sales across all rows, and presents the results in a unified format.

## Features
- **Data Consolidation**: Combines data from 3-4 worksheets into a single main report.
- **Total Sales Calculation**: Automatically sums up the values in the `Total Sales` column and displays the grand total in the report.
- **Dynamic Headers**: Ensures headers are added and formatted in the consolidated report.

## Skills Demonstrated
- VBA Macros
- Data Consolidation
- Cross-Sheet Automation
- Summation and Reporting

## How to Use
1. **Open the File**: Download and open the `Project5QuarterlyReport.xlsm` file in Microsoft Excel.
2. **Enable Macros**: Make sure macros are enabled in your Excel settings.
3. **Run the Macro**:
   - Navigate to the `Developer` tab.
   - Select **Macros** and run the `ConsolidateAndReport` macro (or the macro with a similar name in the file).
4. **Review the Report**:
   - A new worksheet named `Consolidated Report` will be created.
   - Data from all relevant worksheets will be merged into the report.
   - The total sales across all rows will be calculated and displayed at the bottom.

## Requirements
- **Microsoft Excel**: Macros must be enabled for the file to function correctly.
- **Macro-Enabled Workbook**: The file must remain in `.xlsm` format to retain macro functionality.

## Example
